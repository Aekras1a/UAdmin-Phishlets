# UAdmin-Phishlets
UAdmin Phishlets for common sites

# What is UAdmin panel?
UAdmin panel is a phishing site manager, that allows it's administrator to collect logs from phishing sites, as well as hijack OTP codes and 2FA.

UAdmin allows for ***LIVE*** interactions with the victim, as he uses the site, so we can interecept anything we want.

UAdmin is not my program. It was an ukranian panel, which was leaked some time ago. I'm only the developer of phishing sites that work with this.
